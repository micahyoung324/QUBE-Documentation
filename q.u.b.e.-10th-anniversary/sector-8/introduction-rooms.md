# Introduction Rooms

Majority of those rooms are pretty intuitive.

There is very minor optimization in this room: Jump off yellow button early when the sliding wall align with the yellow button position. This way, you can emit green block and get it to launch slightly earlier. This comes with a risk, perhaps unnecessary risk, but it is up to runner to decide whether to implement this minor optimization.

## Laser Ball Intro Room

When you are far away from the sliding wall, it is pretty hard to place the laser block correctly. geerky42 personally recommends to grab red block first to ease the placing.

It is possible to get up there without moving the blue block at the end but you would need to jump into blue block edge it as simply walking into it won't launch you close enough to the platform up there.&#x20;
